# Weather forecast 
This is a project for the Zoomcamp 2022. I will attempt to use all my learnt skills in this project


## Context
Model should predict if there will be a rain tomorrow, base on the data provided [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package), performance of the few classification algorithms will be tested and ideally will parameters will be fined tuned using Optuna.

## Content
This dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia.

Target columng `RainTomorrow`, contains information if there was a rain (which means more than 1mm ) tomorrow  This column is Yes if the rain for that day was 1mm or more.

##
I will attempt to use different models and tuning and choose the best one...
